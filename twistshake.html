            <p>
             Twistshake strives to produce products that are easy and safe to use,<br>
             but which also offer a stylish appearance. They believe that one need not<br>
             exclude the other and their designers are always looking for opportunities to<br> 
             combine the practical with the visual. They have won numerous awards regarding<br>
             design and function, which for them is confirmation that they develop safe,<br>

             <h2>What is an heuristic evaluation?</h2>
             <p>Heuristic evaluation is a process where experts use rules of thumb to measure the usability of user interfaces in independent walkthroughs and report issues.<br>
                Evaluators use established heuristics and reveal insights that can help design teams enhance product usability from early in development. 
                So if you are short on time or money an heuristic evaluation can be a good option instead of usability testing and research with real users.
             </p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
              <h3>3 User control and freedom</h3>
               <p>
                Twistshake is a site that wants to give the customer many choices and that he should be that way in very many cases involved as much as possible in choosing the appearance of the products.<br>
                We therefore wanted to see what this could mean challenges on a site that has so many different products with many choices when it comes to for example color schemes
               </p>
              <h3>6 Recognition rather than recall</h3>  
               <p>
                This heuristic is about the fact that it is easier to recognize things than to recall them<br>
                from memory and how does such a large website facilitate so that the customer does not have to burden the short-term memory unnecessary.
               </p>
              <h3>8 Astehetic and minimalist design</h3> 
               <p>
                Twistshake is a site with many different products in the baby/child range, so we wanted to investigate and analyze how they have worked<br>
                to achieve a clear design that is both aesthetically pleasing in color and design language and minimalist in the way that it is easy and clear to navigate.

            <h2>Checklist over each heuristic</h2>
               <p>We found it easiest to start by writing a checklist for each heuristic so we would more easily know what we were looking for.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2> 
             <li>The website has more focus on the product and nice pictures than on the user.</li>
             <li>It is not easy to understand where on the page you are</li>
             <li>Very difficult to make changes to your order</li>

            <h2>Presentation</h2>
             <p>
                We were lucky enough to have the opportunity to present our evaluation to the company's head of brand and graphic designer.<br>
                During our presentation we showed three problems that we had found. We were objective, careful not to criticize them and focused on solutions rather than the problems.<br>
                She found our presentation very interesting and we gave her som “aha” moments. 
                Quote:
                “I never thought about it but now that I see it, I can't stop thinking about how crazy it is that you can't change it in your shopping cart”

            <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
             <li>Heuristic evaluation is an effective way to evaluate a page.</li>
             <li>It can take any length of time if you don't have clear time frames.</li>
             <li>The heuristics have given me a good overview of what to look for on a page.</li>
             <li>Some points on the checklists can go under several heuristics, so you only need to decide which one it should belong to.</li>
             <li>I’ve been a little brainwashed by this task so now I evaluate every single page I'm on.</li>
             <li>I’ve understood that site evaluations are very important, there are many bad examples out there. But also many good ones.</li>
              <h2>What have i done to improve the group's work</h2>
               <p>
                  As always, we have a very good dynamic in the group, we complement each other. My role has become to check that we are in phase,<br>
                  that we include everything that should be included in the report and make schedules for everything possible.<br>
                  We all understand that life happens sometimes and if someone misses a meeting, we write in the chat what we have come up with.<br>
                  We have said several times that we are very happy with the group we got. Myself think that I am very involved in everything we are going to do and think this is super fun.
